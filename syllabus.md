**Tutorials and office hours**:

To find tutorial schedules and office hours, please refer to the [Calendar](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330/blob/master/docs/calendar.html). Tutorials for this course will be conducted by TAs and follow an office hours format. Attendance at tutorials is optional. However, participating will allow you to engage in more personalized discussions with TAs, providing you with valuable one-on-one time and an opportunity to deepen your understanding of machine learning concepts.

## Registration

**Waitlists**:

The general seats available in this class usually fill up very quickly. Once the general seats are taken, the only way to register for the course is to sign up for the waiting list. For questions about the waiting list policies, see [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses/waitlists). You should sign up for the waiting list even if it is long; a lot of students tend to drop courses. Signing up for the waiting list also makes it more likely that we will open up extra sessions, expand class sizes, or offer additional courses on these topics. The instructors have no control over the situation and I cannot help you bypass the waiting list.

**Prerequisites**: The official prerequisites can be found [here](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?tname=subj-course&course=330&campuscd=UBC&dept=CPSC&pname=subjarea). If you do not meet the prerequisites, see [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses-deadlines/prerequisites) and [here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses-deadlines/rules-about-cpsc-appeals-undergraduate-students). We were told that students should not visit the front desk in the CS main office about prerequisite issues, because the folks at the front desk do not have the authority to resolve prerequisite issues.

In practice, the prerequisite is familiarity with Python programming.

**Auditing**: If the course is full, we cannot accommodate official auditors. If there is space and you would like to audit the course, please contact the instructor. All UBC students are welcome to audit the course unofficially. 

## Grading scheme
 
The grading scheme for the course is as follows:

| Component   | Weight          | Location   |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| Syllabus quiz |   1%          | [Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/149122) | 
| iClicker participation |   5% | [iClicker Cloud]() | 
| Assignments |     22%         | [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.ca/courses/18608) |
| Midterm 1   |     21%         | [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.ca/courses/18608) |
| Midterm 2   |     21%         | [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.ca/courses/18608) |
| Final       |     30%         | [Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/149122)     |


### iClicker 

The iClicker participation grade will mainly consider your engagement rather than the accuracy of your responses. Nevertheless, these questions are intended to facilitate your learning, so please make an earnest effort when providing your answers. 

### Assignments

The plan is that most of the assignments will contribute equally towards the overall Assignments grade. However, this is not finalized yet. For example, the last assignment ends up particularly short or long due to timing. Furthermore, we will drop your lowest homework grade. 
<!--**By default late submissions will not be accepted.** The rationale is that we will be posting the solutions shortly after the assignment deadline, and we cannot accept submissions after the solutions are posted. I do not like this, but I believe the overall policy is best for the class as a whole.--> 
See [this document](docs/homework_instructions.md) for more detailed instructions on submitting homework assignments.

For the full policy on grades, see [this document](docs/grades.md). We understand that grades are important for you for several reasons. But try not to focus too much on them. You will have a better learning experience and in general, you'll be happier in life if you focus more on learning the material well. For the grading scheme we wish we could use [this](https://youtu.be/HdHlfiOAJyE?t=3771).


**Late policy**

Assignments will be due 5 minutes before midnight on the due date.

If you can't make it, you can use late classes:

For example, if assignment is due on a Monday at 11:59 pm:
- Handing it anytime on Tuesday is 1 late day (irrespective of whether it's a holiday).
- Handing it anytime on Wednesday is 2 late days (irrespective of whether it's a holiday).

There is no penalty for using "late days", but you will get a mark of 0 on an assignment if you:
- Use more than 2 late days on the assignment.
- Use more than 4 late days across all assignments.

If you are working in a pair, you both must have late days remaining.

We will post solutions after the second late day has expired.

### Use of AI in the course

Use of AI-based content generation tools, or AI tools, is permitted for assignments and project work in CPSC 330. It is not allowed during midterms and the final exams. 

Additionally, students are required to disclose any use of AI tools for each assignment. This includes
- Referencing the tool used
- Including any prompts used to query
- Including the output of the prompts and a discussion of if/how you modified the result

Failure to follow this policy will be considered a violation of UBC's academic policy. 

When using AI tools for your assignments, be mindful of their impact on your learning. Consider carefully whether they are improving or hindering your learning, and make a conscious decision about their use. 


### Midterm

Check the [Calendar](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330/blob/master/docs/calendar.html) for midterm dates. 

TODO: Write about midterm exam policy. 

### Final exam

The final exam is scheduled for the exam period and is likely to be comprehensive, covering the material taught over the course of the semester.

## Academic concessions

UBC has a [policy on academic concession](https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/academic-learning-resources/academic-concessions) for cases in which a student may be unable to complete coursework. According to this policy, grounds for academic concession can be illness, conflicting responsibilities, or compassionate grounds. Examples of compassionate grounds, from the above policy, include "a traumatic event experienced by the student, a family member, or a close friend; an act of sexual assault or other sexual misconduct experienced by the student, a family member, or a close friend; a death in the family or of a close friend." To request an academic concession, please complete [academic concession form](), clearly indicating the nature of the concession you are seeking, and send the form via email to the course coordinator (cpsc330-admin@cs.ubc.ca), with your instructor copied in the email. Additional documentation might be requested. We will review your situation and determine whether to approve the concession, and if approved, the appropriate steps to follow.

**TODO: Include a link to the standard concession form.** 

## Code of conduct

- If you plan to engage in non-course-related activity in lecture (Facebook, YouTube, chatting with friends, etc), please sit in the last two rows of the room to avoid distracting your classmates.
- Do not distribute any course materials (slides, homework assignments, solutions, notes, etc.) without permission.
- Do not photograph or record lectures (audio or video) without permission.
- If you commit to working with a partner on an assignment, do your fair share of the work.
- If you have a problem or complaint, let the instructor(s) know immediately. Maybe we can fix it!
- During the exam period, do not disclose, discuss, or share any part of the exam with any other individual, except as directly permitted or required by the course instructors. This includes discussion in person, online, or through any electronic means. Violation of this will result in academic penalties, which may include failure of the exam or failure of the course.
